# Comparitive Analysis of Community Detection Algorithms
- Understanding community structure of Twitter Social Media using various community detection algorithms. 
    - Latent Propogation
    - Multilevel
    - Eigen vector
    - Infomap

| Filename | Description |
| --- | --- |
| social-network-mining-code.ipynb |  Code for crawling Twitter snapshot data |
| community-detection-code.ipynb |  Code for running Community Detection algorithms of crawled data |

### Twitter Snapshot Data File
| Data File | Description | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| user_network_muditdham.pickle | saved snapshot data | Standard Pickle Usage

### Twitter Keys
Define the following twitter keys in the oauth_login function before running the crawler code
| CONSUMER_KEY | CONSUMER_SECRET | OAUTH_TOKEN | OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CONSUMER_KEY | CONSUMER_SECRET | OAUTH_TOKEN | OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET | 

### Notes
- Twitter dataset generated by crawling the social media data for a given root user (in this case https://twitter.com/muditdham)
- To access Twitter API functions, do update Twitter parameters with your unique keys to authorize connection to Twitter API
- After hitting the upper limit of Twitter API request calls, the code has a cool down time of 15 minutes and then retries automatically afterwards.
- Crawling snapshot data with me as the root took 2d 22h 43min 17s. Crawled data saved as pickle in data directory and can be used for analysis directly.
